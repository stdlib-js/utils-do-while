    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

## Usage

```javascript
import doWhile from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/utils-do-while@esm/index.mjs';
```

#### doWhile( fcn, predicate\[, thisArg ] )

Invokes a `function` until a `predicate` function returns `false`. Note that the `predicate` function is evaluated **after** executing `fcn`; thus, `fcn` **always** executes at least once.

```javascript
function predicate( i ) {
    return ( i < 5 );
}

function beep( i ) {
    console.log( 'boop: %d', i );
}

doWhile( beep, predicate );
/* =>
    boop: 0
    boop: 1
    boop: 2
    boop: 3
    boop: 4
*/
```

Both the `predicate` function and the `function` to invoke are provided a single argument:

-   **i**: iteration number (starting from zero).

To set the function execution context for the invoked function, provide a `thisArg`.

```javascript
function predicate( i ) {
    return ( i < 5 );
}

function count() {
    this.count += 1;
}

var context = {
    'count': 0
};

doWhile( count, predicate, context );

console.log( context.count );
// => 5
```
